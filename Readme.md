# Studio Ghibli Website

This website is a website made to showcase studio ghiblis films and some merchendise. 
It contains a film list that can be sorted by alphabetical order and chronological order.
It also contains a merchendise store where you can filter out items making finding specific item types easier.
 
## Design Process
 

This project was started as my family and I are fans of studio Ghibli and I wanted them to be able to view and comment on my work therefore allowing me to make improvements based on others opinions. Some improvements I made based on feedback would be the different ways I was pushed to reduce whitespace in my website (using images or increasing the size of some embedded videos or paragraphs).This website was created with the purpose of making an improved version of the official studio ghibli website .

## Features
This website has 3 pages. The first is the home page which contains a Latest Film section and a center logo.
The 2nd page is the films page which shows every film produced by studio ghibli and there is a sort function to sort it by alphabetical order or release date the 3rd page is a merchendise site which allows users to filter out different item types
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
