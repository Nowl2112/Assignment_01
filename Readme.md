# Studio Ghibli Website

This website is a website made to showcase studio ghiblis films and some merchendise. 
It contains a film list that can be sorted by alphabetical order and chronological order.
It also contains a merchendise store where you can filter out items making finding specific item types easier.
 
## Design Process
 

This project was started as my family and I are fans of studio Ghibli and I wanted them to be able to view and comment on my work therefore allowing me to make improvements based on others opinions. Some improvements I made based on feedback would be the different ways I was pushed to reduce whitespace in my website (using images or increasing the size of some embedded videos or paragraphs).This website was created with the purpose of making an improved version of the official studio ghibli website .
